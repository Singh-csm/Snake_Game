### Instructions:
- Create a new **HTML** file with a canvas element that will be used to display the game. You should also create a <div> element that will display the player's score.
- Write a **JavaScript** function that initializes the game by creating the snake and setting its initial position and direction. You should also create a food object that appears randomly on the canvas.
- Write a JavaScript function that updates the game state every frame. This function should move the snake based on its current direction, check for collisions - with the walls and with itself, and check if the snake has eaten the food. If the snake has eaten the food, you should update the score and create a new food object.
- Add event listeners to the document that allow the player to change the direction of the **snake.** You can use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to control the snake.
- Style the web page using CSS to make it look more visually appealing. You can use any styling techniques you like, but make sure the page is easy to read and navigate.

### Requirements:
- The game should be playable and should have clear rules and objectives.
- The game should have a basic scoring system that keeps track of the player's score.
- The snake should be represented by a series of blocks or circles that move across the canvas.
- The food object should be represented by a single block or circle that appears randomly on the canvas.
- The game should be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Your JavaScript code should be well-organized and easy to understand.
- You should use appropriate variable names and comments to explain your code.
